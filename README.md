# Bayes Final Project

The purpose of this project is to predict the presence of fire using smoke detection data and to understand the uncertainty in the predictors for the model we create using Bayesian approaches. 

The data can be found and downloaded from Kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/smoke-detection-dataset

The code for this analysis is in a Jupyter Notebook. To run the Jupyter Notebook, download the data from Kaggle, store the data file (smoke_detection_iot.csv), and change the directory in the code to the location where the file is stored locally. From here, run the notebook as normal.

HMC and ADVI code adapted from Professor Don Brown.
